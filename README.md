# VRMagicDrawing

I'm currently working on a VR spell casting game with a team of friends, where I've been assigned to develop the spell casting system.

For this system, I chose to implement the $1 Unistroke Recognizer to detect and recognize modified drawing patterns. I utilized a specific implementation from StebeeGizmo, who adapted this library for Unity projects. While the project includes the MiVry asset, it is no longer in use.

The scripts I've written can be found in the Scripts folder, with the exception of DollarRecognizer.cs. Although the project contains only a few scripts, I hope they provide insight into my coding style and contribute to your hiring process.
